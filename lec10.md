## Prega News: Mercy Margaret

- Prega news: a brand for pregnancy test
- Poem is about a woman who is struggling to bear a child, she faces criticism from the cruel society, who "weighs woman's worth with children".
- Title indicates that poem is relatively new (tmi?)
- Clouds?
  - 1st stanza: may indicate she is crying, maybe dreaming
  - 2nd stanza: May indicate growth (??)
- Ironic that the poem is filled with references to natural life, and she is struggling to create life.
- Idyllic view of reproduction in the nature vs the imposition of societal norms and expecation
- nature: sees reproduction and motherhood as natural; society normalises the idea of a perfect woman, which sees reproduction as normal (expected) and shuns otherwise.
- "For them she is a barren tree, for herself, a frozen block of ice that is reborn every month" : She still has hope that she may bear children one day (flow like a river ,earlier), reborn is poetic as it indicates that she dies on every negative result and (hope) is born again the next month
- Example of symbolic poetry
