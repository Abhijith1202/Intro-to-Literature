## Characteristics of short stories

### 1. Compression

 Condensing a long duration of time/exp in a few sentences/words. (_long duration_ is subject to the spread duration of the story.)

-  eg: the opening sentence of Chippy condenses his whole Puppyhood into a paragraph; Chippy gaining citizenship of the lanes

### 2. Implicativeness

 Avoidance of repetition by implied context which was provided previously.

- eg: Last line of chippy: the feelings of the dog and the repetitive cycle is implied.

### 3. Rendition

(Showing instead of telling)

- eg: Ending of like the sun, where the headmaster asks Shekhar to submit the papers the next day (shows that even though the headmaster said he didn't mind, he took it to heart); 
- eg: "the drummer and the violinist put away their burden with and air of relief" may mean that they knew all along that the headmaster was bad at it, but they needed someone else to open his eye, as they had to flatter him to keep earning.

### 4. Precise Observation

_Short_ stories, so pick what to include and what not to, and remark an observation in a short manner

- eg: Headmaster treated Shekhar like he was his son-in -law.



## Point of view

It is the way a story gets told/ the voice that narrates the story to us.

- Increasing importance of narrator over past 2 centuries.

- 3rd person narration: Someone outside the story, refers to all characters by name.
  - Omniscient Narrator: knows everything about the character and stories, and has total access to their thoughts, feelings and actions/
    - Unintrusive:
    - Intrusive: 
  - Limited Omniscience: 
- First person narration: narrator is a part of the story.
  - can be a central, minor or peripheral figure.
- Second person narration: Narrator addresses the other person as "you".
  - eg: Italo Calvino's _If on a winter's night a traveller_.
  - Also called self reflexive/involuted novel (includes the story of the creation of the story in it).
