# Technical terms from Abrams and lectures



## Reader Response Criterion

- the meanings of a text are the "production" or "creation" of the individual reader, hence that there is no one "correct" meaning for all readers either of the linguistic parts or of the artistic whole of a text



## Setting

- overall setting of a narrative or dramatic work is the general locale, historical time, and social circumstances in which its action occurs
- the setting of a single episode or scene within such a work is the particular physical location in which it takes place



## Short Story

-  short story differs from the novel in the dimension that Aristotle called "magnitude," and this limitation of length imposes differences both in the effects that the story can achieve and in the choice, elaboration, and management of the elements to achieve those effects.



## Point of view

signifies the way a story gets toldâ€”the mode (or modes) established by an author by means of which the reader is presented with the characters, dialogue, actions, setting, and events which constitute the narrative in a work of fiction

1. **Third person narrative**
   - the narrator is someone outside the story proper who refers to all the characters in the story by name, or as "he," "she," "they". 
   - Omniscient POV
     - the narrator knows everything that needs to be known about the agents, actions, and events, and has privileged access to the characters' thoughts, feelings, and motives; also that the narrator is free to move at will in time and place, to shift from character to character, and to report (or conceal) their speech, doings, and states of consciousness. 
     - intrusive narrator is one who not only reports, but also comments on and evaluates the actions and motives of the characters, and sometimes expresses personal views about human life in general.
   - Limited POV
     - The narrator tells the story in the third person, but stays inside the confines of what is perceived, thought, remembered and felt by a single character (or at most by very few characters) within the story.
   - focus of narration (who tells the story) and focus of character (who perceives what is told us in any part of the story).
2. **First person**
   - In a first-person narrative, the narrator speaks as "I," and is to a greater or lesser degree a participant in the story. 
   - limits the matter of the narrative to what the first-person narrator knows, experiences, infers, or can find out by talking to other characters.
3. **Second Person**
   - In this mode the story gets told solely, or at least primarily, as an address by the narrator to someone he calls by the second-person pronoun "you."



## Metonym

- literal term of one entity is used to refer to another, with which it has become closely associated
- eg: Today I say unto Waris Shah: Waris Shah is a metonym for the Punjabiyat (the shared, syncretic culture of Punjab)



## Figurative language

- is a conspicuous departure from what users of a language apprehend as the standard meaning of words, or else the standard order of words, in order to achieve some special meaning or effect.
- Figures are sometimes described as primarily poetic, but they are integral to the functioning of language and indispensable to all modes of discourse.
- Divided into 2 classes: (distinction is not a sharp one)
  1.  **Figures of thought, or tropes** , in which words or phrases are used in a way that effects a conspicuous change in what we take to be their standard (literal) meaning. 
  2. **Figures of speech, or rhetorical figures, or schemes** , in which the departure from standard usage is not primarily in the meaning of the words, but in the order or syntactical pattern of the words

## Synecdoche 

- Part of something is used to signify the whole, or (rarely) the other way around. 
- eg "ten hands" for ten workmen, or "a hundred sails" for ships and, in current slang, "wheels" to stand for an automobile

## Imagery

-  An image is a mental picture, described in words

1. used to signify all the objects and qualities of sense perception referred to in a poem or other work of literature, whether by literal description, by allusion (indirect reference), or in the vehicles (the secondary references) of its similes and metaphors

2. to signify only specific descriptions of visible objects and scenes, especially if the description is vivid and particularized

3. imagery signifies figurative language, especially the vehicles of metaphors and simile

- makes poem concrete as opposed to abstract
