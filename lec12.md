## Orientalism

- Filled with stereotypes about ppl living in the large "oriental" world (collection of stereotypes)

## Ghazal- Agha Shahid Ali

- Arab: associated with a history of loss ( of homelands, of histories etc)
- Ref to calligraphy
- Sher : 2 lines in a Ghazal
- Ghazal is always in the first person
- Qaafiya: the rhyme part (not a ghazal without a qaafiya)
- Radif
- _I too, O Amichai, saw everything, just like you did- in Death, in Hebrew, and  in Arabic_
  - Yehuda Amichai was an Israeli poet
  - Ali tries to establish that universal themes such as death are what we share as humanity.
  - Such universal themes are shared by even enemies (Jews and arabs, represented by Hebrews and Arabic here)
- Last sher
  - clever use of takhallus (Shahis) to fulfil the structural conditions/features of the ghazal (qaafiya, radif) while also making a meaningful statement that makes sense on its own.
  - Also refers to a long tradition of the Persian love poetry and mystical poetry.
- Refrain: a part of a song or poem that comes again and again.
  - Refrain in the ghazal: In Arabic
