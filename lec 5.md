Continuation of types of narrators:

- Like the sun: first person narration.
- what narration is Chippy?: Its a first person narrator, that never refers to himself (?)
- Narrator is a creation of the author's fiction, and is different from the actual author.
- definitive difference : pronouns (if narrator presents his own views, like "I cannot give a very clear account of Chippy's early life", or "I suppose no human being can ever look..." then its a first person narration, while if the narrator refers in the third person, its third person narration).

## Analyse Chippy's character

- Attention seeking (craved master's attention)
- Superiority complex: considers short dogs and market dogs as inferior.
- has a strong sense of his place in the world (master, food, place...)
- aggressive and easily provoked.
