### Refrain and Return

- refrain: a part in a song or poem that comes again and again
  - Eg: in Ghazal, "_In Arabic_"
- Refrain (in this poem) is also a kind of return in this Ghazal. return is not possible  for the hybrid post-colonial subject as return is as much to an imagined place/homeland as it is to a real place (cuz of changes)
- Return is only possible in language and memory.



## Time's Barter: Kynpham 

- Haiku: 3 lines in a haiku: 5,7,5 syllables each
  - Haikus dont have titles
  - Matsuo Basho, a connoisseur of haikus, describe it as "it is simply what is happening in this place at this moment" 
  - Haiku always marks a particular time, not timeless
  - one of the smallest literary forms in the world.
  - Orig in Japan
  - Literal meaning: Pleasure verse (used to be the first few lines of a poem)
  - mnemonic pattern
  - Formal constraints:
    - Kireji: "cutting word", usually represented in English with a dash or comma
    - Clear mention of season or time of the day
  - Senryu: humorous or satiric haiku (difficult to tell the difference)
  - Haiku is rooted in the experience of a moment, can be deeply personal, and even been used for self portraiture
  - Encourages to slow down and notice contrasts, paradox and irony, elevates them to poetry without making grand gestures (ie, overly complex words)
- Japonisme: European imitation of Japanese art during the 19th and 20th centuries
